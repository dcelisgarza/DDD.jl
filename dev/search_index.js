There are only a finite number of them so an enumerated type provides safety and efficiency. Each value represents a different type of node and therefore its behaviour.\n\nMeaning\n\nnone are uninitialised nodes.\nintMob are mobile nodes internal to the convex hull of the domain. They take part in tractions, displacements and dislocation interactions.\nintFix are fixed nodes internal to the convex hull of the domain. They participate in the same way as intMob nodes except for the fact that their velocities is fixed are zero.\nsrfMob are mobile nodes that live on the surface of the convex hull of the domain, they are used to track slip steps and therefore participate in the same things as internal nodes but their velocities are restricted to the convex hull surface.\nsrfFix are fixed surface nodes and have the same characteristics as mobile surface nodes except for having zero velocity.\next are external nodes that do not participate in dislocation interactions or forces but are used to calculate displacements and track slip steps.\ntmp are nodes that are temporarily flagged before they are assigned another type.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"Types/#","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"AbstractDlnSeg","category":"page"},{"location":"Types/#DDD.AbstractDlnSeg","page":"Types","title":"DDD.AbstractDlnSeg","text":"abstract type AbstractDlnSeg end\nstruct segNone <: AbstractDlnSeg end    # Undefined segment\nstruct segEdge <: AbstractDlnSeg end    # Edge segment\nstruct segEdgeN <: AbstractDlnSeg end   # Edge segment\nstruct segScrew <: AbstractDlnSeg end   # Screw segment\nstruct segMixed <: AbstractDlnSeg end   # Mixed segment\n\nThese types are used to automatically generate segments out of Burgers vectors bmb, slip planes bmn, and/or line direction bml.\n\nMeaning\n\nsegEdge have bmb  bmt ,\nsegEdgeN have bmb  bmt and bmb  bmn ,\nsegScrew have bmb  bmt ,\nsegMixed have none of the above.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"Types/#","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"AbstractDlnStr","category":"page"},{"location":"Types/#DDD.AbstractDlnStr","page":"Types","title":"DDD.AbstractDlnStr","text":"abstract type AbstractDlnStr end\nstruct loopPrism <: AbstractDlnStr end\nstruct loopShear <: AbstractDlnStr end\nconst loopPure = Union{loopPrism,loopShear}\nstruct loopMixed <: AbstractDlnStr end\nstruct loopJog <: AbstractDlnStr end\nstruct loopKink <: AbstractDlnStr end\nconst loopImpure = Union{loopMixed,loopJog,loopKink}\nconst loopDefined = Union{loopPrism,loopShear,loopMixed,loopJog,loopKink}\nstruct loopDln <: AbstractDlnStr end\n\nThese types are used to automatically generate dislocation loops for simulation initialisation.\n\nMeaning\n\nloopPrism are prismatic loops, their Burgers vectors are perpendicular to the their line direction. They are idealised loops that can be automatically generated as n-gons.\nloopShear are shear loops, their line direction goes through edge, screw and line segments as the loop goes round. They are idealised loops that can be automatically generated as n-gons.\nloopPure are idealised loops.\nloopMixed are loops with prismatic and shear character.
